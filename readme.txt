Display maps of running events and races in various countries and regions using data from Race-Calendar.com.

== Description ==

This plugin allows the quick creation and display of regional or global Race Maps - maps which display future running events as pins on a live Google Map - within WordPress blog posts and pages, using simple shortcodes.

Race details are added by event organisers and moderated at [Race-Calendar.com](http://race-calendar.com/ "love2run? Find Your Next Race") , and races are removed from maps once they take place, so that race information is always live and up-to-date.

If runners access your WordPress website, this can enhance their experience, increase pageloads, and lengthen visit length of their visits!
